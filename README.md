# UltimateIVCalculator

Welcome!

This is my IV calculator that utilizes PokeAPI to calculate your IV's on your pokemon for all generations 1-9!

It's a python GUI developed using CustomTkinter. Please go check out the creator's page! https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter

Also a big shoutout to PokeAPI.co! Without them this project would not be possible.

I still plan to update this more in the future, but for now the calculator is fully functional!

You'll find the .exe file at dist/main/UltimateIVCalculator.exe

***Do not move UltimateIVCalculator.exe from dist or it will not run, create a shortcut instead if you want to move it***
